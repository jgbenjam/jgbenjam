## Howdy 🤠

I’m a full stack developer and aspiring systems analyst. I like to decompose problems and rebuild them using my dotnet (.NET) stack. I've also freelanced to build simple websites for personal or business use, mainly using WordPress.

I draw from more than a decade of experience in the fields of software development, project management, solar energy, video game QA testing, LED lighting, and electrical utilities.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on renewing my project management cert for CAPM.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the blockchain.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything IoT.
- 💬 Ask me about flowcharts.
